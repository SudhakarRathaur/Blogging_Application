# Blogging_Application
 This ia a Springboot application using Monolithic Archietecure.


Currently on (4/2/2023) I have problem in implementing in swagger UI documentation beacuse I am finding SpringFox dependency is not compatible with Springboot 3.0 version, may be later I can fix this with the use of OpenApi dependency, when I get time. 


Implementation Details--

1. Database Structure is present in images folder of this repository naming(blogging application er) can be opened using draw.io website.
2. Used MySQL database.
3. Implemented Pagination and Sorting.
4. Implemented Searching.
5. User can also post the image.
6. Secured the application using JWT Authentication.
7. Implemented Role specific API Access.
8. Documneted the API's using Swagger UI.
9. Deployed the application on AWS using BeanStalk Service(http://blogapp-env.eba-phpruym9.ap-northeast-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/).
10. Managed the different Environment of Application as well.
